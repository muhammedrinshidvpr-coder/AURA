## 1. Project Overview

**AURA** is an enterprise-grade campus issue and suggestion governance platform developed for TKM College of Engineering. It replaces fragmented, untracked channels (WhatsApp groups, paper suggestion boxes, and flat Google Forms) with a structured, transparent, and crowd-prioritized system.

### Core Value Propositions:
1. **Anonymous Campus Reporting:** Students can report infrastructural defects and campus suggestions without fear of reprisal. Identity is protected through a **Decoupled Anonymity Vault** at the database level.
2. **Crowd Prioritization (Hype Engine):** Students upvote issues they also experience, pushing high-impact problems to the top of the **Trending** list.
3. **5-State Resolution Pipeline:** Transparent administrative lifecycle (`PENDING → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED / REJECTED`) with official resolution notes visible to students.
4. **100% Java Desktop Architecture:** Built with **Java 17 (SE)**, modern **FlatLaf** desktop GUI, **JDBC DAO patterns**, and cloud-hosted **Supabase PostgreSQL**.

## 4. Quickstart Setup Guide

### Prerequisites:
- **JDK 17** or higher installed and configured on PATH (`java -version`).
- **Apache Maven 3.9+** (`mvn -version`).
- **Supabase Cloud Account** or local PostgreSQL 15+ database instance.

### Setup Instructions:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/muhammedrinshidvpr-coder/AURA.git
cd AURA

# 2. Apply Database Schema and Seed Data in Supabase SQL Editor
# Execute sql/schema.sql followed by sql/seed.sql

# 3. Configure Database Credentials
cp src/main/resources/db.properties.example src/main/resources/db.properties
# Edit db.properties with your Supabase JDBC connection string and password

# 4. Run Automated Unit & Regression Tests
mvn test

# 5. Launch the Modern FlatLaf Desktop Application
mvn exec:java
```
