## How To Use This Manual

This file is written for a team that has a working project but wants to understand how it was built. It should be read as a small project-building course.

Read the manual in this order:

1. Understand the problem AURA solves.
2. Learn the project technologies and the normal development process.
3. Learn the architecture and the responsibility of each layer.
4. Follow the database and model design.
5. Trace the complete workflows from UI to database.
6. Open the referenced source files and compare them with the explanations.
7. Study your assigned member section in detail.
8. Run the tests and reproduce the golden-path workflows.
9. Compare the implemented work with the remaining work before finalization.

This manual does not claim that planned classes exist when they are not present in the current source tree. The repository contains approved design documents that mention future or planned services. Those are clearly marked as **planned/documented**. The code descriptions in this manual are based on classes that actually exist in this branch.

# 1. What AURA Is

## 1.1 The problem

Students may notice a broken projector, network problem, electrical issue, maintenance problem, or campus improvement opportunity. Without a structured system, the report can be lost in informal messages. Administrators also need a queue, priorities, status history, and resolution notes.

AURA provides:

- Student authentication.
- Anonymous campus issue and suggestion submission.
- Private student tracking of submitted tickets.
- Crowd support through a `hype` vote.
- An administrator queue.
- Status transitions from `PENDING` through resolution or rejection.
- Official resolution notes.
- An audit history of status changes.
- Database-level rules for security and data integrity.

## 1.2 The privacy idea

AURA separates the public submission from the private ownership record.

The `submissions` table does **not** contain `student_id`. This means an administrator reading the submission queue cannot directly identify the student who created a ticket.

The private relationship is held in `student_submission_receipts`:

```text
users
  |
  | private student_id
  v
student_submission_receipts
  |
  | submission_id
  v
submissions
```

The student can find their own submission through the receipt table, while the administrator works with anonymous submission data.

## 1.3 Current implementation position

The working core is approximately 70% complete. The current branch contains working or substantially implemented code for:

- Java 17 project setup.
- Maven dependency management.
- Swing and FlatLaf desktop entry point.
- User persistence.
- Password authentication.
- Google OAuth flow structure.
- Domain validation for `@tkmce.ac.in`.
- Session storage and role checks.
- Student submission creation.
- Private receipt creation and lookup.
- Hype persistence and counting.
- Admin submission listing.
- Status updates.
- Resolution notes.
- Submission history.
- PostgreSQL schema and seed data.
- Unit and regression tests.

The main remaining work is around:

- Report generation.
- Analytics and richer dashboard metrics.
- Notifications.
- UI polishing.
- Wider integration and DAO tests.
- More complete history and state edge cases.
- Bug fixing and documentation closure.

# 2. Technology Used in This Project

## 2.1 Java 17

Java is the main programming language. The application logic, desktop UI, service layer, database access, authentication, models, and utilities are written in Java.

Java concepts visible in the project include:

- Classes and objects.
- Interfaces.
- Encapsulation through private fields and public methods.
- Constructors and dependency injection through constructor parameters.
- Inheritance concepts in the approved design.
- Collections such as `List` and `ArrayList`.
- Exceptions and checked `SQLException` handling.
- File/package organization.
- Event-driven GUI programming.
- Threads through `SwingWorker` for browser authentication.
- Records through `GoogleOAuthService.GoogleUserInfo`.
- Enumerated or state values represented by strings in the current implementation.

The current source branch does not contain the `aura.enums` package shown in some architecture documents. The current model and DAO methods use strings such as `STUDENT`, `ADMIN`, `ISSUE`, `SUGGESTION`, `PENDING`, and `RESOLVED`.

## 2.2 Maven

Maven builds the Java project and downloads dependencies from `pom.xml`.

The important dependencies are:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL JDBC driver | Connect Java to PostgreSQL/Supabase |
| FlatLaf | Modern Swing look and feel |
| jBCrypt | Password hashing and verification |
| Gson | Parse Google OAuth JSON responses |
| JUnit Jupiter | Automated tests |

Useful commands:

```powershell
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Build without running tests
mvn -DskipTests package

# Run the application through the configured Maven runner
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=aura.Main
```

## 2.3 Swing and FlatLaf

The application UI is a desktop UI, not a web UI. It uses Java Swing components such as:

- `JFrame` for windows.
- `JPanel` for groups of controls.
- `JButton` for actions.
- `JTextField` and `JPasswordField` for input.
- `JTable` for submission lists.
- `JDialog` for the new-submission form.
- `JOptionPane` for messages and simple prompts.

`Main.java` applies `FlatDarkLaf` before opening the login window.

The repository also contains `mvp_dashboard.html`, but that is a visual reference/MVP file. It is not the main runtime UI. The real application screens are Java Swing classes under `src/main/java/aura/ui`.

## 2.4 JDBC and PostgreSQL/Supabase

JDBC is the Java API used to communicate with a relational database.

The flow is:

```text
Java UI
  -> service class
    -> DAO class
      -> DatabaseConfig
        -> JDBC DriverManager
          -> PostgreSQL/Supabase
```

A DAO uses `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, and `ResultSet`. The DAO is responsible for SQL. The UI must not execute SQL directly.

## 2.5 BCrypt

`PasswordUtil` uses BCrypt to hash passwords before storing them and to verify a supplied password during authentication.

The database stores a hash, not the original password.

## 2.6 Google OAuth and Gson

`GoogleOAuthService` implements the structure of a desktop Google OAuth authorization-code flow:

1. Create OAuth state and PKCE values.
2. Start a local callback server.
3. Open the browser.
4. Receive the callback.
5. Check the state value.
6. Exchange the authorization code for a token.
7. Request user profile information.
8. Return a `GoogleUserInfo` record to `AuthService`.

Gson parses JSON responses from Google.

## 2.7 JUnit 5

JUnit tests verify rules without requiring a person to click every button manually. The current test suite contains 12 passing tests across six test classes.

# 3. How To Build A Project Normally Without An Agent

An agent can type code quickly, but it should not replace project understanding. A normal engineering process is:

## Step 1: Write the problem

Before writing Java, state the user problem in plain language.

For AURA:

> Students need a trusted channel to report campus issues or suggestions, and administrators need an organized, auditable way to resolve them without exposing student identity.

## Step 2: Identify actors and actions

The two main actors are:

- `STUDENT`: logs in, submits, views own submissions, reads updates, and adds hype.
- `ADMIN`: logs in, views the queue, changes status, adds resolution notes, and reviews history.

## Step 3: Write requirements

The repository records requirements in `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/TRD.md`. Requirements become the reason for each later class.

Examples:

| Requirement | Later implementation |
|---|---|
| Student must log in | `LoginFrame`, `AuthService`, `UserDAO`, `SessionContext` |
| Only TKMCE users are allowed | `ValidationUtil`, database email check |
| Students submit issues and suggestions | `SubmissionFormPanel`, `Submission`, `SubmissionDAO` |
| Students view only their own tickets | `StudentReceiptDAO` and receipt table |
| Admin changes state | `AdminDashboardFrame`, `DatabaseSubmissionService`, `SubmissionDAO` |
| State changes are auditable | `SubmissionHistory`, `submission_history`, transaction |
| One student cannot hype twice | `SubmissionHypeDAO`, unique database constraint |

## Step 4: Draw the architecture

Decide which layer owns each responsibility before coding:

```text
aura.ui       -> user actions and display
aura.service  -> business rules and workflow coordination
aura.dao      -> SQL and JDBC
aura.model    -> data objects
aura.config   -> external configuration
aura.util     -> shared rules and session/password helpers
PostgreSQL    -> durable data and constraints
```

## Step 5: Design the database

Write `sql/schema.sql` before writing complicated DAO methods. The schema gives the application a stable contract: table names, columns, keys, checks, indexes, and relationships.

## Step 6: Create models

Create simple Java classes for data that moves between layers. A model should not open a database connection.

## Step 7: Build one vertical slice

Do not build every UI class first. Build one complete path:

```text
Login button
  -> AuthService
    -> UserDAO
      -> users table
        -> User
          -> SessionContext
            -> dashboard
```

Then test it. Repeat for submission and admin resolution.

## Step 8: Add tests while building

For every rule, write a test or a repeatable verification procedure. Test invalid input and failure cases, not only successful cases.

## Step 9: Integrate the team work

Members must agree on method names, field names, table names, IDs, status values, and error behavior. Compilation alone does not prove that two modules integrate correctly.

## Step 10: Finish honestly

Compare the requirements to the actual files. Mark a feature completed only when the code, test, and user-visible behavior exist.

# 5. Architecture In Detail

## 5.1 Presentation layer

The UI layer contains the windows and controls the user interacts with:

- `LoginFrame`
- `StudentDashboardFrame`
- `SubmissionFormPanel`
- `AdminDashboardFrame`

These classes respond to button clicks and show data. They call service classes rather than writing SQL.

## 5.2 Service layer

The service layer coordinates actions and applies business rules:

- `AuthService`: login, registration, OAuth, logout, role checks.
- `GoogleOAuthService`: browser OAuth protocol.
- `DatabaseSubmissionService`: concrete submission-service implementation.
- `HypeService`: hype behavior.
- `ServiceRegistry`: supplies the submission service.
- `SubmissionService`: interface defining submission operations.

The service layer is where an action becomes a business operation. For example, “change status” is not merely one SQL update: the service must know the old status, request the new status, identify the admin, and ensure history is recorded.

## 5.3 DAO layer

The DAO layer is the database boundary:

- `UserDAO`: user CRUD and lookup.
- `SubmissionDAO`: submissions, receipts, status history, and resolution notes.
- `StudentReceiptDAO`: private student receipt lookup.
- `SubmissionHypeDAO`: hype insert, remove, count, and duplicate checks.

## 5.4 Model layer

Models carry data:

- `User`
- `Submission`
- `ResolutionNote`
- `SubmissionHistory`

They contain fields and getters/setters. They do not know how to connect to PostgreSQL.

## 5.5 Configuration and utilities

`DatabaseConfig` creates connections from local properties or environment values. `OAuthConfig` reads OAuth settings. `PasswordUtil`, `ValidationUtil`, and `SessionContext` provide shared rules.

## 5.6 Dependency direction

The intended direction is downward:

```text
LoginFrame
  -> AuthService
    -> UserDAO
      -> DatabaseConfig
        -> PostgreSQL
```

A class should not skip its layer. For example, `LoginFrame` should not call `UserDAO` directly, and `AuthService` should not construct a `Connection` itself.

---

# 6. Database Design From Scratch

## 6.1 Tables

The actual schema creates six main tables.

### `users`

Stores students and administrators.

Important columns:

- `user_id`: primary key.
- `name`.
- `email`: unique and restricted to `@tkmce.ac.in`.
- `password_hash`.
- `role`: `STUDENT` or `ADMIN`.
- `created_at`.

### `submissions`

Stores anonymous issues and suggestions.

Important columns:

- `submission_id`: primary key.
- `title`.
- `description`.
- `type`: `ISSUE` or `SUGGESTION`.
- `category`.
- `location`.
- `priority`.
- `status`.
- `photo_url`.
- `created_at`.

There is intentionally no `student_id` column.

### `student_submission_receipts`

Stores the private mapping between a student and a submission.

- `receipt_id`: primary key.
- `student_id`: foreign key to `users`.
- `submission_id`: foreign key to `submissions`.
- Unique pair: one student cannot receive the same submission twice.

### `submission_hype`

Stores student support votes.

- `hype_id`: primary key.
- `submission_id`: foreign key.
- `student_id`: foreign key.
- Unique pair: one student cannot hype the same submission twice.

### `resolution_notes`

Stores official administrator notes.

- `note_id`.
- `submission_id`.
- `admin_id`.
- `note`.
- `created_at`.

### `submission_history`

Stores status transitions.

- `history_id`.
- `submission_id`.
- `old_status`.
- `new_status`.
- `changed_by`.
- `changed_at`.

## 6.2 Constraints

The database is not just passive storage. It enforces important rules:

- Primary keys identify rows.
- Foreign keys prevent references to missing users or submissions.
- Email checks prevent non-institutional addresses.
- Status checks restrict values to the lifecycle states.
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate receipts and hypes.
- Indexes improve lookup by status, category, priority, hype, and student receipt.

## 6.3 Setup order

1. Create or open the PostgreSQL/Supabase project.
2. Run `sql/schema.sql`.
3. Run `sql/seed.sql`.
4. Copy `src/main/resources/db.properties.example` to a local `db.properties`.
5. Set the database URL, user, password, and driver.
6. Run tests or start the application.

## 6.4 Seed data

The seed script contains:

- Four student users.
- Two admin users.
- Five sample submissions.
- Private receipt mappings.
- Hype votes.
- Resolution notes.
- Status history rows.

The seed data exists so the team can learn and demonstrate the application without first entering every record manually.

# 7. Class-by-Class Learning Map

## 7.1 `Main.java`

**Location:** `src/main/java/aura/Main.java`

Purpose:

1. Apply `FlatDarkLaf`.
2. Start Swing work through `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.
3. Create and display `LoginFrame`.

Study question: Why should the UI start on the Swing event thread? Because Swing UI work is expected to be coordinated through its event-dispatching mechanism.

## 7.2 `DatabaseConfig.java`

**Location:** `src/main/java/aura/config/DatabaseConfig.java`

Purpose:

1. Load `db.properties` from the classpath.
2. Read `db.url`, `db.user`, and `db.password`.
3. Allow environment-variable fallback.
4. Load the PostgreSQL driver.
5. Return a JDBC `Connection`.

It prevents every DAO from duplicating connection setup.

## 7.3 `OAuthConfig.java`

Loads OAuth values such as client ID, client secret, redirect URI, server port, enforced domain, and development mode.

## 7.4 `User.java`

Represents a user. Current fields include the user ID, name, email, password hash, role, and creation data as defined by the current model.

The user object is used by `UserDAO`, `AuthService`, `SessionContext`, and the UI routing logic.

## 7.5 `Submission.java`

Represents a public anonymous ticket. It contains issue/suggestion data and status information but no student-author field.

It is used by the submission service, DAO, student dashboard, and admin dashboard.

## 7.6 `ResolutionNote.java`

Represents an official note written by an administrator for a submission.

## 7.7 `SubmissionHistory.java`

Represents a status transition and the administrator/user ID that caused it.

## 7.8 `AuthService.java`

Main authentication coordinator.

Important methods:

- `authenticate(String email, String password)`.
- `registerStudent(String name, String email, String password)`.
- `loginWithGoogle()`.
- `loginMock(String role)`.
- `logout(int userId)` and `logout()`.
- `isCurrentUserAdmin()`.
- `isCurrentUser(User user)`.
- `validateCredentials(...)`.

The service validates input, calls the user DAO, verifies passwords, provisions OAuth students, and updates the session.

## 7.9 `GoogleOAuthService.java`

Implements the browser-based OAuth flow. It uses:

- `HttpServer` for the local callback.
- `Desktop` to open the browser.
- `HttpClient` for token/profile requests.
- PKCE verifier/challenge values.
- A cryptographic state value.
- Gson JSON parsing.

## 7.10 `DatabaseSubmissionService.java`

Implements `SubmissionService` and coordinates submission operations through `SubmissionDAO`.

It connects UI requests to DAO behavior and turns low-level data failures into service-level runtime failures for the UI.

## 7.11 `HypeService.java`

Provides the business-facing hype operations:

- Add hype.
- Remove hype.
- Count hype.
- Check whether a student already hyped a ticket.

It delegates persistence to `SubmissionHypeDAO`.

## 7.12 `ServiceRegistry.java`

Provides the submission service used by both dashboards. It is a small composition point so the UI does not construct all database dependencies itself.

## 7.13 DAOs

### `UserDAO`

Performs user insert, lookup, update, and delete operations.

### `SubmissionDAO`

Performs submission persistence, full listing, ID lookup, receipt creation, status changes, history, and resolution-note operations.

### `StudentReceiptDAO`

Performs private ownership mapping operations.

### `SubmissionHypeDAO`

Performs hype persistence and checks.

## 7.14 UI classes

### `LoginFrame`

Collects password or OAuth login and routes the user to the correct dashboard.

### `StudentDashboardFrame`

Shows student submissions and provides new submission, refresh, hype, detail, and logout actions.

### `SubmissionFormPanel`

Collects title, description, type, category, location, priority, and photo URL information.

### `AdminDashboardFrame`

Shows the administrator queue and provides refresh, status change, note, history, and logout actions.

## 7.15 Utilities

### `PasswordUtil`

Hashes and verifies passwords with BCrypt.

### `ValidationUtil`

Validates institutional email addresses and minimum password length and normalizes email values.

### `SessionContext`

Stores the current authenticated `User` and exposes role checks.

---

# 8. Code Patterns Used in the Project

## 8.1 Model object creation

The UI creates a `Submission` object from form fields. It does not write SQL:

```java
Submission submission = new Submission();
submission.setTitle(title);
submission.setDescription(description);
submission.setType(type);
submission.setCategory(category);
submission.setLocation(location);
submission.setPriority(priority);
submission.setPhotoUrl(photoUrl);
```

The object then crosses into the service layer.

## 8.2 Service call

The student dashboard uses the service contract:

```java
SubmissionService service = ServiceRegistry.getSubmissionService();
service.createSubmission(submission, user.getUserId());
```

The UI knows the operation it needs, not the SQL details.

## 8.3 Prepared statement

A DAO uses parameters rather than string concatenation:

```java
String sql = "SELECT user_id, name, email, password_hash, role "
        + "FROM users WHERE email = ?";

try (Connection connection = DatabaseConfig.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    statement.setString(1, ValidationUtil.normalizeEmail(email));
    try (ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery()) {
        return results.next() ? mapUser(results) : null;
    }
}
```

This is safer and keeps database values separate from SQL syntax.

## 8.4 Row mapping

A DAO reads a `ResultSet` and constructs a model:

```java
User user = new User();
user.setUserId(results.getInt("user_id"));
user.setName(results.getString("name"));
user.setEmail(results.getString("email"));
user.setPasswordHash(results.getString("password_hash"));
user.setRole(results.getString("role"));
return user;
```

## 8.5 Transaction

Creating a submission and its receipt must succeed together:

```java
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
// insert submission
// read generated submission ID
// insert private receipt
connection.commit();
```

If a database exception occurs, the code rolls back. This prevents a submission without a receipt or a receipt pointing to a missing submission.

## 8.6 Event-driven UI

A button receives an action listener. The listener calls a service and refreshes the UI:

```java
newSubmission.addActionListener(event -> openSubmissionDialog());
refresh.addActionListener(event -> loadSubmissions());
```

The application waits for the user event instead of running in a fixed command-line sequence.

## 8.7 Background OAuth work

Google login uses `SwingWorker` so a browser/network operation does not freeze the Swing UI:

```java
new SwingWorker<User, Void>() {
    @Override
    protected User doInBackground() throws Exception {
        return authService.loginWithGoogle();
    }

    @Override
    protected void done() {
        // Read the result and open the dashboard.
    }
}.execute();
```

---

# 9. Complete Workflow Traces

## 9.1 Password login

1. User enters email and password in `LoginFrame`.
2. `passwordLogin()` reads the fields.
3. `AuthService.authenticate()` validates non-null input and format.
4. `ValidationUtil` checks the institutional email and password length.
5. `UserDAO.findByEmail()` executes a prepared query.
6. `PasswordUtil.verifyPassword()` checks BCrypt.
7. `SessionContext.setCurrentUser(user)` stores the session.
8. `LoginFrame.openDashboard()` checks the role.
9. `AdminDashboardFrame` opens for admin; `StudentDashboardFrame` opens for student.

## 9.2 Google login

1. User clicks Google login.
2. `LoginFrame` starts `SwingWorker`.
3. `AuthService.loginWithGoogle()` calls `GoogleOAuthService`.
4. OAuth service starts a local callback server.
5. It creates state and PKCE values.
6. It opens Google in the browser.
7. Google redirects to `/callback`.
8. The service checks the callback state.
9. It exchanges the authorization code.
10. It retrieves the profile.
11. `AuthService` validates `@tkmce.ac.in`.
12. It finds or creates a student account.
13. It stores the session and returns the user.
14. The UI opens the student dashboard.

## 9.3 Student submission

1. Student opens `StudentDashboardFrame`.
2. Student clicks `New Submission`.
3. `SubmissionFormPanel` collects the fields.
4. The form creates a `Submission` object.
5. The callback calls `SubmissionService.createSubmission(...)`.
6. `DatabaseSubmissionService` delegates to `SubmissionDAO.createWithReceipt(...)`.
7. DAO inserts the anonymous `submissions` row.
8. DAO reads the generated ID.
9. DAO inserts `(student_id, submission_id)` into the receipt table.
10. DAO commits the transaction.
11. Dashboard reloads IDs through the receipt path.
12. Student sees the ticket in their own table.

## 9.4 Student hype

1. Student selects a ticket.
2. Dashboard reads its submission ID.
3. `HypeService.addHype()` is called.
4. `SubmissionHypeDAO` checks or inserts the vote.
5. The database unique constraint prevents a duplicate pair.
6. Dashboard reloads the list and displays the count.
7. `SubmissionDAO.findAll()` orders submissions using hype count and creation time.

## 9.5 Admin resolution

1. Admin logs in.
2. `AdminDashboardFrame` verifies `SessionContext.isAdmin()`.
3. The dashboard calls `listAllSubmissions()`.
4. The service retrieves the queue through `SubmissionDAO`.
5. Admin selects a row.
6. Admin chooses a new status.
7. Service reads the current submission.
8. DAO updates the status.
9. DAO inserts a `submission_history` record.
10. Both operations commit in one transaction.
11. Admin may add a `ResolutionNote`.
12. Student can read the resulting history/note through the service flow.

# 10. Testing And Verification

## 10.1 Current test classes

| Test class | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `AuthServiceTest` | Authentication validation and authentication behavior |
| `DatabaseSubmissionServiceTest` | Submission service operations |
| `HypeServiceTest` | Hype behavior |
| `PasswordUtilTest` | BCrypt hashing and verification |
| `ValidationUtilTest` | TKMCE email and password rules |
| `AdminAnonymityRegressionTest` | Admin path does not expose student identity |

The current Maven run reports 12 tests passing.

## 10.2 How to study a test

For every test, identify:

1. What input is given?
2. What class is being tested?
3. What result is expected?
4. Which rule does the test protect?
5. What future code change could break it?

## 10.3 Manual golden path

When database configuration is available, verify:

1. Start with seeded data.
2. Log in as a student.
3. Create an issue or suggestion.
4. Confirm it appears in the student's own list.
5. Add hype to a ticket.
6. Log out.
7. Log in as an admin.
8. Confirm the admin queue shows submissions without author identity.
9. Change a status.
10. Add a resolution note.
11. View history.
12. Log out.
13. Log in as the student again.
14. Confirm the student can see the update for their own ticket.

## 10.4 Verification evidence

For the rubric, keep evidence such as:

- Source files with the member's name or ownership mapping.
- SQL schema and seed data.
- Test output.
- Screenshots of working student/admin flows.
- A written explanation of a technical decision.
- A failed case and the fix that resolved it.
- A planned-versus-completed table.

---

# 11. Five Member Learning Tracks

The official ownership matrix is recorded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the first presentation. The sections below follow that matrix. The current branch may not contain every class named by the approved design, so each track separates **implemented files** from **planned/documented work**.

- `ValidationUtil` rejects non-TKMCE email addresses.
- `PasswordUtil.hashPassword()` prevents plaintext persistence.
- `PasswordUtil.verifyPassword()` checks a candidate password.
- `SessionContext` stores the current user.
- Dashboard constructors enforce role checks.
- `StudentReceiptDAO` accesses the private receipt table.
- `AdminAnonymityRegressionTest` protects the no-author-exposure rule.

### Java verification examples

```java
public boolean isCurrentUser(User user) {
    User currentUser = SessionContext.getCurrentUser();
    return user != null
            && currentUser != null
            && currentUser.getUserId() == user.getUserId();
}
```

Explain every condition:

- `user != null`: there must be a user to compare.
- `currentUser != null`: a session must exist.
- IDs must match: the object must belong to the current session.

### Demonstration to prepare

1. Show an invalid external email being rejected.
2. Show a valid TKMCE email being normalized.
3. Explain where the BCrypt hash is created.
4. Show how a successful login sets `SessionContext`.
5. Show why an admin cannot open the student frame.
6. Show why `submissions` has no `student_id`.
7. Show how the receipt lookup finds a student's own submission.

### Remaining learning work

- Understand OAuth configuration rather than only mock login.
- Verify missing configuration errors.
- Test unauthorized paths and receipt ownership edge cases.
- Explain the security design without claiming that mock mode is production authentication.

## Part B — Muhammed Rinshid

### Assigned responsibility

**Team Lead: System Coordination, Core Architecture, and Supabase Integration**

### Main files to study

- `src/main/java/aura/Main.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/config/DatabaseConfig.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/config/OAuthConfig.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/ui/LoginFrame.java`
- `pom.xml`
- `src/main/resources/db.properties.example`
- `src/main/resources/oauth.properties.example`
- `README.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/TRD.md`

### What to learn first

Learn packages, Maven, application startup, configuration separation, dependency direction, Swing event-thread startup, JDBC connection creation, and integration testing.

### What this part coordinates

1. Start the application.
2. Apply FlatLaf.
3. Open the login screen.
4. Load database configuration.
5. Connect Java to Supabase/PostgreSQL.
6. Keep secrets outside committed source.
7. Coordinate the boundaries between member modules.

### Startup walkthrough

`Main.main()`:

1. Attempts to set `FlatDarkLaf`.
2. Calls `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.
3. Creates `LoginFrame`.
4. Makes the frame visible.

### Database configuration walkthrough

`DatabaseConfig.getConnection()`:

1. Reads `db.url`.
2. Reads `db.user`.
3. Reads `db.password`.
4. Loads the configured driver.
5. Calls `DriverManager.getConnection`.
6. Returns a connection to the DAO.

The UI does not know the password or connection details. This is configuration separation.

### Integration responsibility

The team lead should know the complete request path:

```text
Main
  -> LoginFrame
    -> AuthService
      -> UserDAO / DatabaseSubmissionService
        -> DatabaseConfig
          -> PostgreSQL/Supabase
```

### Java verification examples

```java
SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
    LoginFrame loginFrame = new LoginFrame();
    loginFrame.setVisible(true);
});
```

Explain why the UI is created inside `invokeLater` and why `Main` does not contain database SQL.

### Demonstration to prepare

1. Run the application entry point.
2. Explain the Maven dependencies in `pom.xml`.
3. Show how the local properties files avoid hard-coded credentials.
4. Explain how a DAO receives a configured connection.
5. Draw the complete architecture from UI to database.
6. Explain how member contracts allow five people to work independently.

### Remaining learning work

- Verify the Supabase connection with real local configuration.
- Run the end-to-end golden path.
- Coordinate merging, test failures, and configuration setup.
- Document any environment-specific issues without placing secrets in Git.

## Part C — Nirmal

### Assigned responsibility

**Proposed Solution, Models, UML, and Hype/Trending Engine**

### Main files to study

- `src/main/java/aura/model/User.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/model/Submission.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/model/ResolutionNote.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/model/SubmissionHistory.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/dao/SubmissionHypeDAO.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/service/HypeService.java`
- `src/test/java/aura/service/HypeServiceTest.java`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`

### What to learn first

Learn Java classes, fields, constructors, getters/setters, object relationships, `List`, DAO delegation, unique database constraints, and sorting/aggregation.

### Model responsibility

A model answers: “What data does this part of the domain carry?”

- `User` carries identity and role data.
- `Submission` carries anonymous ticket data.
- `ResolutionNote` carries administrator response data.
- `SubmissionHistory` carries state transition data.

The current branch uses strings for role, type, priority, and status. The documentation describes a future or approved enum design, but the actual current source must be studied first.

### Hype responsibility

A hype is a student support vote. The database prevents the same student from hyping the same submission twice:

```sql
CONSTRAINT uq_hype_once_per_student
UNIQUE (submission_id, student_id)
```

`HypeService` is the business-facing class. `SubmissionHypeDAO` is the database-facing class.

### Hype workflow

1. Dashboard reads the selected submission ID.
2. Dashboard calls `HypeService.addHype`.
3. Service calls `SubmissionHypeDAO`.
4. DAO inserts the student/submission pair.
5. The database rejects duplicates.
6. `SubmissionDAO.findAll()` counts hypes and sorts the queue.

### Java verification examples

```java
public int getHypeCount(int submissionId) {
    try {
        return hypeDAO.countForSubmission(submissionId);
    } catch (SQLException exception) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to count hypes.", exception);
    }
}
```

Explain why the service catches `SQLException` and exposes an application-level failure rather than making the UI understand database internals.

### Demonstration to prepare

1. Explain each field in `Submission`.
2. Draw relationships among `User`, `Submission`, `ResolutionNote`, and `SubmissionHistory`.
3. Add a hype vote.
4. Try the same vote again and explain the uniqueness rule.
5. Show how hype count affects list ordering.
6. Explain why a model does not open a database connection.

### Easier scoring focus

This is one of the more structured parts to defend because the relationships are visible in the model classes, SQL tables, service methods, and hype test. Prepare a clear class-to-table-to-workflow explanation and use the real method names.

### Remaining learning work

- Align the documented UML and current model source carefully.
- Add or strengthen tests for duplicate hype and count ordering.
- Understand whether typed enums are required for the final approved implementation before changing public APIs.

## Part D — Rahandeep

### Assigned responsibility

**Database Engineering and FlatLaf Desktop GUI**

### Main files to study

- `sql/schema.sql`
- `sql/seed.sql`
- `src/main/java/aura/dao/UserDAO.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/dao/SubmissionDAO.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/ui/student/StudentDashboardFrame.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/ui/student/SubmissionFormPanel.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/ui/LoginFrame.java`
- `src/test/java/aura/service/DatabaseSubmissionServiceTest.java`
- `docs/DATABASE.md`
- `docs/SECURITY.md`

### What to learn first

Learn relational tables, primary and foreign keys, SQL `INSERT`/`SELECT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, JDBC resource handling, Swing components, listeners, table models, and transactions.

### Database responsibility

You should be able to explain:

- Why `users` is created before dependent tables.
- Why `submissions` intentionally has no student ID.
- Why receipts need foreign keys.
- Why hype needs a unique pair.
- Why status/history updates use a transaction.
- Why indexes improve queue and receipt lookups.

### DAO responsibility

`UserDAO` maps users.

`SubmissionDAO` is the largest current DAO. It:

- Saves submissions.
- Finds one submission.
- Finds all submissions.
- Creates a submission and receipt.
- Updates status.
- Records history.
- Adds resolution notes.
- Reads notes and history.
- Deletes submissions.

### GUI responsibility

`StudentDashboardFrame`:

- Verifies the student session.
- Loads submissions.
- Displays a non-editable `JTable`.
- Opens the form dialog.
- Adds hype.
- Shows details.
- Logs out.

`SubmissionFormPanel` collects the new ticket fields.

### Java/JDBC verification example

```java
try (Connection connection = DatabaseConfig.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql,
             Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS)) {
    bindSubmission(statement, submission);
    statement.executeUpdate();
    try (ResultSet keys = statement.getGeneratedKeys()) {
        if (keys.next()) {
            submission.setSubmissionId(keys.getInt(1));
        }
    }
}
```

Explain:

- `try-with-resources` closes objects.
- `PreparedStatement` binds values safely.
- Generated keys return the new submission ID.
- The ID is required for the receipt.

### Demonstration to prepare

1. Run the schema in order.
2. Explain every table and key.
3. Show one DAO `SELECT` and one DAO `INSERT`.
4. Explain the generated-key flow.
5. Open the student dashboard.
6. Create a ticket through the form.
7. Show the table refresh.
8. Explain how the Java listener calls a service.

### Easier scoring focus

This is a highly demonstrable section because the schema, SQL, JDBC code, and student screen can be shown directly. Prepare diagrams of one complete operation from button click to database row.

### Remaining learning work

- Expand DAO integration tests.
- Test missing connection configuration.
- Improve form validation and UI error/loading states.
- Confirm the database schema and current Java mappings remain synchronized.

## Part E — Adil Rahman

### Assigned responsibility

**Audit Lifecycle, Admin Dashboard, and Analytics**

### Main files to study

- `src/main/java/aura/ui/admin/AdminDashboardFrame.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/service/DatabaseSubmissionService.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/service/SubmissionService.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/model/SubmissionHistory.java`
- `src/main/java/aura/model/ResolutionNote.java`
- `sql/schema.sql`
- `sql/seed.sql`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/TESTING.md`

### Planned/documented classes to identify honestly

Some design documents mention `TrackingService`, `ReportService`, and `ResolutionNoteDAO`. They are part of the approved/documented target architecture, but they are not present as separate Java files in the current source tree. The current implementation places relevant operations in:

- `DatabaseSubmissionService`.
- `SubmissionService`.
- `SubmissionDAO`.
- `AdminDashboardFrame`.

This distinction is important in a technical explanation: describe what exists, then explain what still needs to be extracted or completed.

### Admin workflow responsibility

`AdminDashboardFrame`:

1. Checks for an authenticated admin.
2. Loads all submissions.
3. Displays ID, title, status, and hype.
4. Lets the admin change status.
5. Lets the admin add a resolution note.
6. Shows history and notes.
7. Refreshes the queue.
8. Logs out.

### Audit lifecycle

The current lifecycle values are:

```text
PENDING
  -> ASSIGNED
    -> IN_PROGRESS
      -> RESOLVED

PENDING or other valid state
  -> REJECTED
```

The database records both the current state and the history of transitions.

### Status update code idea

The DAO operation performs two writes in one transaction:

```java
UPDATE submissions
SET status = ?
WHERE submission_id = ?;

INSERT INTO submission_history
(submission_id, old_status, new_status, changed_by)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);
```

If either write fails, the transaction rolls back.

### Analytics and reports status

The approved requirements describe dashboard metrics and CSV reports. The current branch has the queue, hype count, history, and notes, but does not contain separate `ReportService` or `TrackingService` classes. These are remaining implementation work rather than completed source modules.

### Demonstration to prepare

1. Log in as an admin.
2. Explain the role check.
3. Show the queue and the fields displayed.
4. Change a ticket status.
5. Explain how the old and new status are stored.
6. Add a resolution note.
7. View history.
8. State clearly that report generation and analytics require the next implementation phase.

### Easier scoring focus

This section has a visible workflow and a strong database audit story. To score well, connect the UI control, service method, DAO transaction, `submission_history` row, and displayed result. Do not claim that analytics/report classes exist until they are implemented.

### Remaining learning work

- Implement a dedicated report output path.
- Decide and implement analytics metrics.
- Add richer filters and dashboard summaries.
- Add tests for invalid state transitions and rollback behavior.
- Decide how notifications should be represented in the final scope.

---

# 15. Final Technical Questions

Every member should eventually answer these without reading the manual:

1. What problem does AURA solve?
2. Why is AURA a Java desktop application?
3. Why does the project use Swing and FlatLaf?
4. What does Maven do?
5. What is the difference between a UI class, service, DAO, and model?
6. Where does SQL execute?
7. How does Java connect to PostgreSQL?
8. Why is `PreparedStatement` used?
9. Why is `student_id` missing from `submissions`?
10. How does the receipt vault work?
11. How does password login work?
12. How does Google OAuth work in this project?
13. What does `SessionContext` store?
14. How does an admin change a status?
15. Why are status update and history insertion in one transaction?
16. How does hype prevent duplicate votes?
17. Which current classes are planned in documentation but absent from code?
18. What is completed now?
19. What remains in the 30%?
20. Which member owns each technical area?

If a member can answer these questions, trace the source files, run the tests, and demonstrate one feature, the team has moved from merely possessing an agent-generated project to understanding and owning the project technically.
