## 2. Team Member Viva Defense Matrix (Slide 17 Alignment)

Every team member has dedicated module ownership derived from Slide 17 of [`docs/AURA.pdf`](AURA.pdf). The following questions and technical answers must be defended by the assigned member during the viva voce.

```
========================================================================================
TEAM MEMBER 1: MUHAMMED RINSHID VP (B25CS045) — TEAM LEAD & SYSTEM COORDINATOR
Slides Owned: 1–4, 20 | Module: Core Architecture, DatabaseConfig, Google OAuth Bridge
========================================================================================
```

### Q1.1: What is the core problem AURA solves, and which UN SDGs does it address?
> **Answer:**  
> "AURA replaces fragmented, untracked channels (WhatsApp groups, paper suggestion boxes, flat Google forms) with a structured, transparent, 5-state campus governance platform at TKMCE. It directly aligns with:
> - **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions):** Transparent, auditable campus grievance redressal.
> - **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities):** Safe, accessible campus infrastructure and maintenance.
> - **SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure):** Transition from archaic paper systems to modern Java SE architecture.
> - **SDG 4 (Quality Education):** Prevents lab and classroom downtime through swift issue resolution." (Slides 3–4)

### Q1.2: How is the database connection managed, and how do you handle cloud network failures?
> **Answer:**  
> "We implement a Singleton Connection Factory in `aura.config.DatabaseConfig` backed by HikariCP-compatible pooled JDBC connections to Supabase PostgreSQL 17.6. To guarantee high availability against intermittent ISP DNS hiccups, we configured a multi-host failover JDBC URL:
> `jdbc:postgresql://aws-0-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432,54.64.190.72:5432/postgres?sslmode=require`
> If domain resolution hangs or fails, the PostgreSQL JDBC driver transparently fails over to the direct AWS ELB IP address without interrupting user operations."

========================================================================================
TEAM MEMBER 2: NIRMAL BINOY (B25CS052) — CORE DEVELOPER (HYPE ENGINE & MODELING)
Slides Owned: 5–8 | Module: Proposed Solution, UML Class Modeling, HypeService, SubmissionHypeDAO
========================================================================================
```

### Q2.1: How does the Crowd Prioritization (Hype Engine) work, and how do you prevent double-voting?
> **Answer:**  
> "The Hype Engine aggregates community urgency. In `HypeService`, when a student upvotes an issue, it invokes `SubmissionHypeDAO.toggleHype(submissionId, studentId)`. At the database level, the `submission_hype` table enforces a composite unique constraint:
> `CONSTRAINT uq_submission_student UNIQUE (submission_id, student_id)`
> If the record already exists, it is deleted (toggle off); if it does not exist, an `INSERT` executes (toggle on). This guarantees mathematical idempotency and prevents vote manipulation." (Slide 8, 14)

### Q2.2: Explain the UML Class Model and the relationships between Submission, User, and Hype.
> **Answer:**  
> "The model follows clean OOP domain modeling in package `aura.model`:
> - `User` contains role-based attributes (`STUDENT` vs `ADMIN`).
> - `Submission` is an aggregate entity with strongly typed enums (`Category`, `Priority`, `SubmissionType`, `SubmissionStatus`).
> - Notably, `Submission` does NOT aggregate or reference `User` directly. This structural separation upholds the Decoupled Anonymity Vault." (Slide 14)

========================================================================================
TEAM MEMBER 3: MOHAMMED NAFIH (B25CS037) — SECURITY & ANONYMITY VAULT LEAD
Slides Owned: 9–12 | Module: RBAC Pipeline, AuthService, StudentReceiptDAO, PasswordUtil
========================================================================================
```

### Q3.1: Prove that campus administrators cannot identify who submitted an issue.
> **Answer:**  
> "The proof is twofold:
> 1. **Relational Schema Isolation:** The `submissions` table contains NO `student_id` or `user_id` column. When a submission is inserted, only an anonymous ticket row is created.
> 2. **Decoupled Anonymity Vault:** The mapping between student and ticket is written to an isolated table, `student_submission_receipts (receipt_id, student_id, submission_id)`.
> 3. **Architectural Access Boundary:** `student_submission_receipts` is only accessible via `StudentReceiptDAO`, which is strictly invoked by `TrackingService` during the authenticated student's session. No administrative class (`aura.ui.admin.*` or `AdminSubmissionService`) contains any queries or methods referencing receipts.
> 4. **Automated Verification:** `AdminAnonymityRegressionTest` automatically inspects all admin queries to verify zero access to receipt records." (Slides 10, 11, 16)

### Q3.2: How are user credentials secured in transit and at rest?
> **Answer:**  
> "Passwords are salted and hashed using `jBCrypt` with a work factor of 10 in `PasswordUtil.hashPassword()`. Plaintext passwords never touch the database or exception logs. Institutional domain gating strictly validates that all logins and registrations match the regex `^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@tkmce\\.ac\\.in$`." (Slide 9, 16)

========================================================================================
TEAM MEMBER 4: RAHANDEEP RD (B25CS053) — DATABASE & GUI ENGINEER
Slides Owned: 13–14, 18 | Module: PostgreSQL Schema, FlatLaf Modern GUI, SubmissionDAO
========================================================================================
```

### Q4.1: Explain the layer boundaries between FlatLaf Swing UI and the Database.
> **Answer:**  
> "Our architecture follows a strict 4-tier model:
> `aura.ui (Swing)` → `aura.service` → `aura.dao` → `Supabase PostgreSQL`
> - `aura.ui` never imports `java.sql.*` and never touches `aura.dao`. All actions pass through service orchestrators.
> - `aura.dao` is the only package permitted to execute SQL queries.
> - Every DAO method uses `try-with-resources` to guarantee that `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, and `ResultSet` are closed immediately, preventing connection leaks." (Slides 13, 14, 18)

### Q4.2: How does FlatLaf modernize the desktop experience over standard Swing?
> **Answer:**  
> "Standard Swing uses dated native widgets (Metal or Windows 98 aesthetic). In `aura.ui.common.UITheme`, we initialize `FlatDarkLaf`, providing high-DPI scaling, CSS-like rounded corners, modern color tokens (`BG_BASE #0F172A`, `PRIMARY #6366F1`), badge status pills, and responsive layout management." (Slide 20–23)

========================================================================================
TEAM MEMBER 5: ATHIL RAHUMAN A (B25CS084) — DOCUMENTATION, TESTING & AUDIT LEAD
Slides Owned: 15–17, 19 | Module: State Lifecycle, ReportService, JUnit 5 Test Suite, CSV Export
========================================================================================
```

### Q5.1: What is the 5-State Resolution Pipeline and how is the audit trail maintained?
> **Answer:**  
> "Submissions progress through 5 deterministic states:
> `PENDING → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED / REJECTED`
> Whenever an administrator updates a status or attaches an official resolution explanation in `AdminDashboardFrame`, `ResolutionNoteDAO` logs the timestamp, admin ID, and resolution text. This note is immediately rendered back to the student in their 'My Submissions' panel, closing the feedback loop." (Slide 15, 19)

### Q5.2: How does the CSV Export feature work and how is it tested?
> **Answer:**  
> "`ReportService.generateCsvReport()` aggregates all submission records with category, priority, status, and hype counts. It formats records according to RFC-4180 specifications, properly escaping commas and quotes. In `SubmissionAndHypeServiceTest.testReportServiceCsvGeneration()`, we verify that the output contains all standard column headers and valid submission rows." (Slide 19, 28)
