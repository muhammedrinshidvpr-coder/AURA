## 1. 10-Week Development Schedule (Slide 28 Alignment)

This roadmap directly maps to the 10-week academic development schedule approved during Phase 1 (Slide 28 of [`docs/AURA.pdf`](AURA.pdf)). It provides clear evidence of **"Significant progress beyond Phase 1"** as required by the presentation evaluation rubric:

## 3. Deliberately Out of Scope for Phase 2

To maintain focus on the core student-admin governance loop and ensure defensibility before faculty examiners, the following features remain scheduled for future release:
- Native mobile client (Desktop Java SE is the syllabus requirement).
- Real-time chat threads between students and admins.
- Multi-campus / Multi-university tenancy (TKMCE-only by design).
